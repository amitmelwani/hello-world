# hello-world
Hi world, I'm working to get educated on GitHub and software development in general. This is step 1.


Travling and exploring is so important to me that I considered making my Github profile name nomadic-amit. Then I realized that's harder to remember and share than my first and last name, so I went with amitmelwani instead.
